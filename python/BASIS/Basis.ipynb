    "\n",
    "- Early 1990s: Python was created by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.\n",
    "- February 1991: Python 0.9.0 was released, introducing features like classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions, and the core data types of list, dict, str, etc.\n",
    "- 1994: Python 1.0 was released, adding important features like lambda, map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "- 2000: Python 2.0 was introduced. This version included many major new features like list comprehensions, garbage collection system, and Unicode support.\n",
    "- 2008: Python 3.0, a major, backward-incompatible release, was launched. It was designed to rectify fundamental design flaws in the language.\n",
    "- 2010s: Python's popularity surged, especially in data science, machine learning, and web development communities.\n",
    "- 2020: End of life for Python 2. Python 3 continued to evolve with regular updates, focusing on efficiency, security, and library enhancements.\n",
    "- Ongoing: Python remains one of the most popular programming languages, known for its simplicity and elegance, with a strong and active community continuously contributing to its development and a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks."
